# Functions-Frontend
# Function With Frontend
For this project, we created a simple contract with 2-3 functions and displayed the values of those functions in the frontend of the application.

## Features

### Public State Variables:
- **Owner**: Public variable storing the address of the contract owner.
- **Balance**: Public variable holding the current balance of the contract.

### Functions:
- **deposit**: Public function that allows the contract owner to deposit `_amount` of Ether into the contract.
- **withdraw**: Public function that allows the contract owner to withdraw `_withdrawAmount` of Ether from the contract.

## Functionality
1. The smart contract has at least two functions.
2. The values from the smart contract functions are visible on the frontend of the application.
3. This Solidity contract `Tasks` provides basic functionalities to deposit and withdraw Ether, ensuring that only the owner can perform these actions.

## Deploying the Contract
1. Code read-aloud is submitted.
2. Code read-aloud is complete (all steps explained).
3. Code read-aloud is clear and understandable.
4. Conduct the test by yourself.
